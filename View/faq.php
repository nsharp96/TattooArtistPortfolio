        <div class="question">
            <h1>How do I take care of my tattoo?</h1>
            <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                <p>After the tattoo is completed, I will wrap it in cling film. I recommend to keep this on for roughly 2 hours. After this time, the wrap should be 
                    removed and the tattoo should be throughly cleaned using non fraganced soap and warm water. Pat dry the tattoo after with fresh paper towels. Do
                    not use hand towels or toilet roll as these can contaminate the tattoo. For the next two days, the tattoo may weep plasma, this is completely normal.
                    If it has weeped plasma just clean the tattoo and dry as recommended. After roughly two days, the tattoo should start to dry up. From this point,
                    you can use a small amount of cream to moisturise the tattoo. Do not use too much or over moitsurise the tattoo. I recmommend using Palmer's Cocoa
                    Butter. If the tattoo forms any scabs, do not pick or scratch them as this will lead to possible drop out of ink.

        <div class="question">
            <h1>How much is the deposit?</h1>
            <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                <p> Deposits vary depending on the tattoo on which you are getting. Small tattoos will require a £50 depoist while larger tattoos will require a 
                    £100 deposit. The deposit comes off the price of the tattoo at the end unless you roll it over to another appointment. To move a booking,
                    please inform me within 48 hours of the tattoo as otherwise you will lose the deposit.
